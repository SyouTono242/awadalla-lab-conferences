<h1>Awesome Conferences for Awesome Lab(s)</h1>
</div>
A curated list of conferences somewhat relevant to the Awadalla Lab (and some other labs maybe)... `flag_outdated_entries.py` allows you to check for potentially outdated entries and URLs --- please run it from time to time + manual checks to make sure things are up-to-date. Entries are generally ordered based on their impact/reputation in the field (which is perceived by me so no guarantee lol).

All contributions welcomed.

## Computer-Science-ish

Note that conferences in the computer science list are ordered by h5-index, since conference publications in CS are viewed equally, if not more important (wellllll I personally feel like usually more important), than journal papers. 

Values shown were obtained from [Google Scholar Engineering & Computer Science](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng). Last updated in May 2025 to cover articles published in 2019-2023.
